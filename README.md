# IoT_App
Project for WIT IOT Applications Module

The idea is that it would allow us to monitor a small private snooker club that we set up in town. At present all members have their own keys and come and go as they please so you never know who's there at any time or if tables are available. 

This would allow us to open a stream to the club to see if tables are free. It would also monitor temp for the tables and allow us to turn on/off special tables heaters we have under each table to help the pro cloths we have on the tables run as fast as they should as humidity plays a big part in it.

The temp is monitored by the Blynk app and also thingspeak which tweets out if it goes above 35 degrees, this would also be set up for low temp.

The arp-scan is set up to monitor any devices connected to the wifi and we could have all members phones/laptops held on file to monitor if anyone has been in the club and connected to the wifi. 

If anyone if connected it pushes the name to thingspeak which in turn tweets it out and can be viewed on the blynk app or reviewed later.

The blynk app also has the ability to take a STILL photo, 10 SEC VIDEO, or open a live stream from the PI CAMERA
